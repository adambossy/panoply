"""Adapter for American Express "Enhanced Details" CSV exports with preamble.

This adapter locates the real CSV header within files that include one or more
human‑readable preamble lines above the column header, then delegates row → CTV
mapping to the existing AmEx‑like adapter to keep normalization identical.

Contract
--------
- The real header row must match exactly (after stripping the line ending):

  ``Date, Description, Card Member, Account #, Amount, Extended Details,``
  ``Appears On Your Statement As, Address, City/State, Zip Code, Country,``
  ``Reference, Category``

- Required columns (exact names) that must be present once the header is
  found:
  ``{"Date", "Description", "Amount", "Extended Details",``
  ``"Appears On Your Statement As", "Reference"}``

- Output CTV objects have the same shape and normalization as
  :mod:`packages.financial_analysis.ingest.adapters.amex_like_csv`:
  keys: ``idx, id, description, amount, date, merchant, memo``.

Failure mode
------------
If the header cannot be located or required columns are missing, a
``csv.Error`` is raised with a clear, actionable message. The CLI already
surfaces ``csv.Error`` as a parse failure without altering its error-handling
contract.
