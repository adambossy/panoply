"""Public interface for the ``financial_analysis`` package.

This module exposes the package's API functions and public models/types as the
stable import surface. There is no runtime logic hereâ€”only symbol re-exports.

Note: This package currently defines interfaces and CLI stubs only. All
callables raise ``NotImplementedError`` by design; implementation details are
intentionally out of scope for this iteration.
