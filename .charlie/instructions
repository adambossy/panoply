CLI framework requirement
- All new CLI entry points and any CLI refactors in this repository must use the Typer library. Commands should be exposed via a Typer app. Do not implement CLI parsing with argparse or custom parsers.

Environment loading requirement
- Load environment variables from a .env file using the python-dotenv package (e.g., load_dotenv). Do not use a custom dotenv loader. By default, the loader must not override environment variables that are already set.

Scale and production quality
- This app is for use for a single person. Don't assume that it needs observability, has any external clients, or any other production-quality frills.

Code quality
- Try to avoid long functions. Try to keep functions relatively decomposed with descriptive function names.
- Avoid using nested function. If you define a function that needs a lot of nested functions, separate them into their own module.
- Don't import modules inside of functions. Only keep imports at the module's top level.

Style
- Don't use banner comments.
